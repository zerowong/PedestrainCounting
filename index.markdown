Pedestrain Counting
==============

This is the group project of Digital Image Processing, Tsinghua University, 2015 Spring. We have three great partners:

- [Zhengrong Wang](https://zerowong.github.io/)
- [Hsienyu Meng](https://github.com/xianyuMeng)
- [Liuyang Zhan](https://github.com/zhanlythu)

You will find all the docs [here](https://zerowong.github.io/PedestrainCounting/docs/html/index.html). 

We are still working on it, so the docs may not be maintained very well.
